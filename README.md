# ed2klink
NOT VALIDATED ed2k link processor extension for phpBB 3.1+ forums, based in the original MOD for previous versions.

This extension doesn't pass the phpBB official validation process, and I wont do further work on it.

It's published here without any warranty and I don't take responsability about failures or any problem in your forums or anywhere.
